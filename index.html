      <strong>Sourabh Kabra – AVP Product Management, Testbook</strong>
      <blockquote>
        I had the pleasure of working with Upasana during her time at Testbook, where she joined as a fresher. In just 2-3 months of training, she quickly rose to a level where she could independently lead features... This mindset has been key to her success and made her an invaluable asset to my team. I do not doubt that Upasana would be a great addition to any team.
